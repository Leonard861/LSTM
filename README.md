Summary :
This project is a research-based learning (RBL) project for “FI3203 Simulation and Modeling Physical Systems” course at Physics ITB. In this project, I developed a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) model, which is one of the best machine learning models for forecasting time series data. The model achieved Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE) of 1.44% and Mean Absolute Error (MAE) of 150.11, indicating that the model performs well in predicting stock prices.

Duration : December 2024 (2 Weeks)

Role : Build Machine Learning Model

Contributions :
•	Collected BBCA stock data from Yahoo Finance.
•	Preprocessed data, including checking missing value, normalizing data, windowing data, and splitting data.
•	Developed a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) model.
•	Trained and evaluated the model.
•	Visualized the comparison between actual prices and predicted prices.

Results :
The model achieved Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE) of 1.44% and Mean Absolute Error (MAE) of 150.11, indicating that the model performs well in predicting stock prices.
